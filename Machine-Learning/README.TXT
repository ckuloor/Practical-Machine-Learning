Practical Machine Learning Course Project
=================================================
This repository contains the data files, .rmd and html files prepared for the coursera practical machine learning course project.

The project requirements:
================================================

Given the training and test data sets on human activities measurements, the goal is to build models and predict the way people do their activites. Various types of prediction
models are built and compared. Cross validation is used. Finally the best model is chosen and the class outcome is predicted using the best model.

Files : 

pml-training.csv - The given training data set.

pml-testing.csv -  The given test data set.
 
pml-testing-predicted.csv - The testing data set with the predicted classe outcome.

Machine_Learning_Course_Project.rmd - The R mark down file for the project

Machine_Learning_Course_Project.html - The generated html file from the markdown file.
